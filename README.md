## üìå About Me

My journey into bioinformatics was catalyzed by my grandfather, Krzysztof Krƒôc, a distinguished mycologist and an alumnus of [UMCS](https://www.umcs.pl/en/). Motivated by his legacy and my personal challenge with disability, I ventured into the world of biology, eventually discovering the transformative discipline of bioinformatics. I am committed to unraveling biological complexities at a molecular level, and my research portfolio is a testament to this dedication.
