## 📌 About Me

My **bio**-journey was inspired by my Grandpa, Krzysztof Kręc, who was a mycologist graduated from [UMCS](https://www.umcs.pl/en/). Inspired by my Grandpa I delved into the depths of biology, **overcoming my disability**. I've found out that one can "make biology" by means other than working in a vetlab - that is how I discovered fascinating field of **bioinormatics**. 
As a passionate bioinformatic scientist, I've delved into the intricacies of life at the molecular level.
