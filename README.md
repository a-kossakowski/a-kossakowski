## 📌 Quick Intro

Bioinformatics found me through my grandfather—Krzysztof Kręc, a noted mycologist and proud UMCS alumnus. Inspired by his legacy (and motivated by proving a disability doesn’t define me), I swapped the wet-lab pipette for a terminal prompt and never looked back. Today I untangle molecular puzzles, write plenty of Python, and still geek out over a beautiful fungal genome.
